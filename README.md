# finalprojectfewd22

For my final project I redesigned a website for a psychotherapist, using content provided. I updated the look
to a more professional style, using border radius to create circular frames for the images. I worked to make
a consistent style-book across several pages of content, while making adjustments for varying sizes of items.
I used Html5 to get the latest possible arrangements of elements, and css3 for separate stylesheets for each page.
JQuery was used to make a drop down read more button for one of the longer sectionss. Finally I added a surprise button
to change the home page to a Star Trek theme using Jquery to toggle classes on the body in order to apply different styles
and to replace images and text and put them back again when the class is changed back to the normal theme.
The original page is at http://www.susanbhagen.com/ for comparison.
