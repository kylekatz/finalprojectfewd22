		<p id="bio">Susan Hagen originates from farm-country in Northern Minnesota.  It was there she was inspired to become a stand-up comedian while standing in a field of sunflowers.  This young dream did not pan out but clearly propelled her early career choices:  paper delivery &quot;boy,&quot; car hop, lifelong college student, pretzel vendor at the Boston Garden.  After re-locating to Madrid, Spain Susan graduated from college and began her teaching career until the Spanish government rejected her 5th visa extension request and she returned to the US.  Back in the US she moved to Boston to begin a holding pattern of public school teaching in which her lack of skills in classroom management surfaced.  She was relieved to leave the classroom and pursue a 2nd master&rsquo;s degree in the field of Psychotherapy.   Susan&rsquo;s psychotherapeutic skills flourished and today she has her own successful private practice in Cambridge, MA.  Susan&rsquo;s profession as an inspirational humorist originated in the sunflower fields of Minnesota, refined and matured through happenstance, calamity and divine interruption over the years and has swelled into a successful career.  &quot;It is all part of the deal.&quot;</p>
