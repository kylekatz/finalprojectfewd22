        	<p class="tapping">We create our own experience; we are the source of what is happening to us. This truth should not generate despair but an opportunity to take control of your emotional, and in turn, your physical life.  At the heart of all you experience is your understanding of your own worthiness and desire.  This is the internal work of everyone's life.</p>
        	<p class="tapping">There is a creative power, a source that is connected to the universe in everyone.  You have the ability to use it toward what you desire and to build a life that is full of prosperity and joy.  But this is, at first an internal job.  The group is a study on the relationship between that source in ourselves and in our surroundings.</p>
       		<p class="tapping">Present-focused groups are unlimited in their reach for you but they are structured in their content.  The goal and purpose of the group is:  To develp the practice of accessing and aligning ourselves with the creative power and source within us in order to  attain emotional, spiritual and physical freedom and prosperity.

		<h2>Susan's Approach to Psychotherapy<h2>
			<article>
				<p class="therapy">Susan B. Hagen, MA, MEd, Psychotherapist, is committed to working with individuals who seek a deeper self-awareness. Her private practice is based in Cambridge, Massachusetts.</p>
				<p>Susan Hagen is a natural teacher and communicator. Her passion is found in guiding people on their path to learning about themselves through discovery, risking vulnerability and beholding something new. As a private practitioner, Susan works with individuals who have experienced difficult childhoods and who desire healing at a deeper level.  She offers Inner-Child focused groups; a radical approach to healing through facing and dealing with  the unfinished business of the past and Present-focused groups; "Tapping into your Source."
				</p>
				<p>Susan Hagen is well-known for her straightforward approach to her work.</p>
				<p>"I believe that someone who comes to me for guidance and help needs to feel and see real change within a short amount of time.  Although real change happens over time and is not always easy or comfortable, motivation to pursue this form of change comes through our initial sense of feeling hopeful that something will change for the better.  My gift is inciting this hope to change."</p>
				<p>She is also known for her keen ability to communicate simply in order to access relevant information. Her sense of humor flows through her work effortlessly.  She is a master at helping people feel comfortable and challenged at the same time.  She originates from Northern Minnesota where her Norwegian roots were cultivated. All of this balanced with an impressive academic resume.
